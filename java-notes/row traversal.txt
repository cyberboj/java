row major traversal & column major traversal


- number of subarrays in a 2D array is arrayname.length
- the length of the subarrays would be arrayname[0].length;
- The number of columns is the same as the number of elements within a subarray and the number of rows is the same as the number of subarrays in a 2D array.

- For example, you may want to only retrieve elements without keeping track of the indices using enhanced for loops, or you could continuously update the 2D array until a condition is met using while loops.
- In enhanced for loops, each element is iterated through until the end of the array. When we think about the structure of 2D arrays in Java (arrays of array objects) then we know that the outer enhanced for loop elements are going to be arrays.


Enhanced for loops for 1D:

for (int element : array) {
	System.out.println();
}


Enhanced for loops for 2D:

for (type[] row/outerArray : array) {
	for(type element : row) {
		System.out.print(element + " "); //prints elements in the same row with space in between
	  } 
	  System.out.println(); //moving on to next line   
	}
	
	
Same thing but with while loops

int i=0; j=0;
while(i<array.length) {
	j =0;
	while(j<array[j].length) {
		System.out.print(array[i][j] + " ");
		j++;
	}
	System.out.println();
	i++;
}


Row major traversal: this order for 2D arrays refers to a traversal path which moves horizontally through each row starting at the first row and ending with the last.
