What we'll learn:

* installing VMWare / Kali Linux
* Kali Linux overview
* navigating the file system
* users and privileges
* common network commands
* viewing, creating and editing files
* starting and stopping services
* installing and updating tools
* scripting with Bash


Two ways to run Kali:
- VM
- install as OS  


Exploring Kali Linux:
- home (to navigate)
- terminal
- kazoo (to screen record or take screenshots)
- burpsuite is an important tool for web application penetration testing
- Zenmap is the graphical tool version of nmap. Nmap allows you to scan machines for open ports and vulnerabilities.
- metasploit is a tool as well 
- cherry tree; a very cool note taking app


Navigating the file system.
  Commands we'll learn:
- pwd; present working directory
- cd; how we change directories   
- ls, listing and finding hidden folders with ls
- mkdir, rmdir; making and removing directories
- cp, rm, mv, locate; copying, removing, moving and locating files
- updatedb; locating files
- passwd; password and how to change that
- man; a very important command

How to navigate the filesystem:

* pwd shows you the current folder you're in

/home/kali

* cd .. is to go backwards in a folder

/home

* ls will list everything in the folder

bin   home            lib32       media  root  sys  vmlinuz
boot  initrd.img      lib64       mnt    run   tmp  vmlinuz.old
dev   initrd.img.old  libx32      opt    sbin  usr
etc   lib             lost+found  proc   srv   var

* cd ~/foldername to go directly to a folder.e.g. to go to Desktop, cd ~/Desktop

* mkdir foldername/ to make a folder and then ls to see it
* rmdir foldername/ to remove folder

* ls -la to show hidden files in a folder
