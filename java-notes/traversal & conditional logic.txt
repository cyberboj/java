- it is important to be able to combine traversal logic with conditional logic in order to effectively navigate and process the data.
- conditional logic can affect your 2D traversal by:
	* Skipping or selecting certain rows and columns
	* Modifying elements only if they meet certain conditions
	* Complex calculations using the 2D array data
	* Formatting the 2D array
	* Avoiding exceptions / smart processing
